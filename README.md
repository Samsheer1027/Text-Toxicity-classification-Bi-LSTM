# Text Toxicity Classification with Bi-LSTM

## Overview

Text Toxicity Classification with Bi-LSTM is a project aimed at building a robust natural language processing (NLP) model to classify text content based on toxicity. The primary focus is on developing a solution that can effectively identify and categorize toxic language in textual data using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network.

## Project Description

Toxicity in online communication has become a significant concern, and automated classification systems play a crucial role in identifying and moderating toxic content. This project leverages the power of Bi-LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to understand the sequential nature of language and make accurate toxicity predictions.

## Project Structure

- **/data:** This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the model.
  
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the exploration, preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the Bi-LSTM model.

- **/src:** Source code for the Bi-LSTM model and any helper functions.

- **/models:** Saved models after training for deployment or further analysis.
